%\section{Microarray classification using single-objective metaheuristic algorithms}
This chapter primarily discusses the existing works on classification algorithms for microarray data. The related literature is broadly categorized into three parts: (i) algorithms based on single objective optimization, (ii) multi-objective optimization, and (iii) MapReduce-based parallel techniques.
