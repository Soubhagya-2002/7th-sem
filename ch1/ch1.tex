\section{An Overview of Power Loss Allocation} % section headings are printed smaller than chapter names
% intro
The electrical power sector in many countries has been either deregulated or is in the process of getting deregulated. Several issues are coming up due to this as different generations, transmissions, and distributions companies are being set up in a single state-owned vertically integrated structure, with the primary objective to introduce competition to bring down the cost of electricity and to enhance the service quality. 

\section{Literature Review}
Pro-rata scheme (PR) \cite{gonzalez1999spanish,ilic2013power} allocates losses to the network participants as per their load demands without considering geographical locations of the end-users. Hence, this procedure is found to be unfair to the consumers of equal load demands placed nearer to the substation as compared to those placed far away. But, this drawback is not found in MW-mile techniques \cite{pan2000review,shirmohammadi1989evaluation,shirmohammadi1991cost,shirmohammadi1996some,lima1996allocation} because,
